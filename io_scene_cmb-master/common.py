def get_bone_ids_in_order(bones_parents_ids):
    '''return a list of bone ids, ordered such that a bone id never appears before its parent

    A utility function to get bone ids in an order suitable for positioning bones in the rest pose (where parent bones must always be positioned before their children) or animations (where child bones must be positioned before their parents).

    bones_parents_ids: a list of 2-tuples (bone id, parent bone id). The first value is the ID number of a bone from a CMB model or the equivalent bone in a Blender armature. The second value is the ID number of that bone's parent bone, or a negative number if it has no parent.

    return value: a list of bone ids, ordered such that a bone id never appears before its parent. The root bone (bone with no parent) is always first, and child bones of a parent bone can appear anywhere as long as it isn't before the parent bone.

    Example:
      bones_parents_ids: [(0,-1), (1,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5)]
        (equivalent to the following bone hierarchy)
                     0
                  /     \
                 1       5
                /|\     /|\
               2 3 4   6 7 8
      return value:
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
        But if the items in bones_parents_ids were ordered differently (which wouldn't affect the bone hierarchy), other potential return values would include:
        [0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        [0, 1, 5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]
        In short, the return value's order doesn't matter as long as a parent bone never appears after any of its child bones.
